# :warning: DEPRECATED :warning:

The PropertyCross project is in maintenance mode https://github.com/tastejs/PropertyCross/issues/338#issuecomment-296971528, hence there will be no more work on this application.  As it was a number of the API's used were no longer functioning as originally specified so it was not possible to fully implement.

This application is based on the PropertyCross reqiuirements that are used to showcase different mobile development frameworks.

More information can be found here http://propertycross.com/ and the specifications here https://github.com/tastejs/PropertyCross/tree/master/specification
